# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 1 | Confusing and frustrating. Difficult to edit profile and job searches brought up more irrelevant results than relevant ones. |
| Site 2 | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 LinkedIn
I already had a LinkedIn account prior to this lab.

![LinkedIn Profile Navigation](../assets/LinkedIn%20Goto%20Profile.png)
I was able to go to my profile from the home page by clicking on "Me" in the top navigation menu, then selecting my profile.

![LinkedIn Adding Skill pt.1](../assets/LinkedIn%20Skill%20Navigation.png)
To add a skill, I had to select "Add profile section", then select "Add skill" from the popup menu.

![LinkedIn Adding Skill pt.2](../assets/LinkedIn%20Skill%20Selection.png)
Once I was at the Add Skill menu, I could type in a skill to add (or select a recommended one), then select a location where I had used it.

![LinkedIn Job Search](../assets/LinkedIn%20Job%20Search.png)
To search for a job, I had to select "Jobs" from the top navigation, then type a search term and a location in the search bar. From there, I had to look through the list of jobs and find one to apply for.

![LinkedIn Job Application](../assets/LinkedIn%20Job%20Application.png)
After selecting Apply under a job, I was brought to that company's website, where I could select Apply from there and reach an application form.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 0 | I had a lot of difficulty searching adding sections to my profile, and the process of searching for jobs was convoluted. I had to redo my search numerous times to get job sites that fit my skillset, and even then most of the results were promoted results that were only listed due to their popularity. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1 | It took multiple clicks and selections to go to where I wanted to, and it was difficult to figure out how to perform certain actions. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 1 | While the top navigation made sense, actually looking for how to perform certain actions was confusing and tedious. It was never obvious that the search bar that was always there was how you searched for jobs, and it took me some time to figure out that Add Profile Section was where I added new skills. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1 | After searching for a job, I had to sift through numerous irrelevant jobs to find the ones that were actually relevant to my search. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1 | The profile and job search sites are very wordy and somewhat cluttered. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1 | Only two of the tabs on the main navigation are relevant to job searches, and on both pages it is difficult and confusing to look for what can be edited and used.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2 | I was able to tab through each page and reach the desired locations, although There was a lot to tab through |
| **TOTAL** | 1 | This website was frustrating to use, since it was never obvious what needed to be selected to edit profile information, and job searches only had a spattering of relevant jobs versus the numerous unrelated results. |

## 2.3 Site 2
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |   |   |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |   |   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |   |   |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |   |   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |   |   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |   |   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |   |   |
| **TOTAL** |   |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Search for a Recipe |
| Description / Steps | 1. The user navigates to the search menu within the app<br> 2. The user inputs a search term and presses the Search button<br> 3. A list of recipes is brought up based on the search term, organized by how well they match the user's current skill levels<br> 4. The user looks through the recipes until they find one they like<br> 5. The user either bookmarks the recipe for later use or selects it to begin cooking |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | The user has an account |
| Postconditions | The user will have bookmarked or completed a new recipe |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Epicurious](www.epicurious.com)
2. Competitor 2 [Yummly](www.yummly.com)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to the [website](www.yummly.com) | I chose yummly over epicurious because it focuses more on recipes over simply having articles |
| 2 | Sign up or create an account | This step can come later if necessary because it does not affect being able to look up recipes, only to save them |
| 3 | Search for a recipe or keyword | The search bar is at the top, and autofills suggestions |
| 4 | Select a recipe to look at | You can also hover over a recipe to see a preview of its ingredients, or bookmark it directly from the search menu |
| 5 | Analyze and bookmark the chosen recipe | You may have to go to a separate website to view directions |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to the [website](www.yummly.com) | The user was able to simply search up the website on Google and find it as the first result |
| 2 | Sign up or create an account | The signup button was the first option in the navigation menu at the top left, and the user could sign in with social media and Google |
| 3 | Search for a recipe or keyword | The user clicked on the search bar and was able to have their search term autofilled |
| 4 | Select a recipe to look at | While it was easy for the user to find and select a recipe, they got popups every time they selected one, which were annoying to close. They were pleasantly surprised to see reviews for each recipe |
| 5 | Analyze and bookmark the chosen recipe | The recipe the user had selected had the recipe ight on the page. The user was pleasantly surprised to see that there were premade collections to place the bookmarked recipe in as opposed to a general bookmarks page. They were concerned that the popup that shows how to bookmark a recipe does not reappear if they miss it |

## Step 3.5 Findings
*Potential improvements:*
- Place a sign up button outside the navigation menu so it can be selected with a single click
- Reduce the amount of popups that appear after selecting a recipe
- Make the popup that shows how to bookmark a recipe reappear until it is performed

*Beneficial experiences:*
- Signup could be completed with two clicks: select a login method, then confirm using that platform
- Searching for a recipe was simplified by autofill, allowing the user to type less

*What we did well:*

Our team did well collaborating and making sure we all had the same use case to work with. That way, our usability tests would all be similar in nature and easy to check between one another.

*What we could improve:*

It was difficult to decide on what app to perform the usability test on, since some people had already done it by the time others had started.

*Overall experience:*

While it was simple enough to write and perform the test, it was difficult to get valuable responses from the user. For most of the test, the user did not have any frustrations or surprises with the process, and their reactions were very neutral. Thankfully, the times they did have a reaction were good enough to make up for this, so I was able to get a good amount of data from it.

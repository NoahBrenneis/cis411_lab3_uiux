# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Search for a Recipe |
| Description / Steps | 1. The user navigates to the search menu within the app<br> 2. The user inputs a search term and presses the Search button<br> 3. A list of recipes is brought up based on the search term, organized by how well they match the user's current skill levels<br> 4. The user looks through the recipes until they find one they like<br> 5. The user either bookmarks the recipe for later use or selects it to begin cooking |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | The user has an account |
| Postconditions | The user will have bookmarked or completed a new recipe |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Epicurious](www.epicurious.com)
2. Competitor 2 [Yummly](www.yummly.com)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to the [website](www.yummly.com) | I chose yummly over epicurious because it focuses more on recipes over simply having articles |
| 2 | Sign up or create an account | This step can come later if necessary because it does not affect being able to look up recipes, only to save them |
| 3 | Search for a recipe or keyword | The search bar is at the top, and autofills suggestions |
| 4 | Select a recipe to look at | You can also hover over a recipe to see a preview of its ingredients, or bookmark it directly from the search menu |
| 5 | Analyze and bookmark the chosen recipe | You may have to go to a separate website to view directions |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to the [website](www.yummly.com) | The user was able to simply search up the website on Google and find it as the first result |
| 2 | Sign up or create an account | The signup button was the first option in the navigation menu at the top left, and the user could sign in with social media and Google |
| 3 | Search for a recipe or keyword | The user clicked on the search bar and was able to have their search term autofilled |
| 4 | Select a recipe to look at | While it was easy for the user to find and select a recipe, they got popups every time they selected one, which were annoying to close. They were pleasantly surprised to see reviews for each recipe |
| 5 | Analyze and bookmark the chosen recipe | The recipe the user had selected had the recipe ight on the page. The user was pleasantly surprised to see that there were premade collections to place the bookmarked recipe in as opposed to a general bookmarks page. They were concerned that the popup that shows how to bookmark a recipe does not reappear if they miss it |

## Step 3.5 Findings
*Potential improvements:*
- Place a sign up button outside the navigation menu so it can be selected with a single click
- Reduce the amount of popups that appear after selecting a recipe
- Make the popup that shows how to bookmark a recipe reappear until it is performed

*Beneficial experiences:*
- Signup could be completed with two clicks: select a login method, then confirm using that platform
- Searching for a recipe was simplified by autofill, allowing the user to type less

*What we did well:*

Our team did well collaborating and making sure we all had the same use case to work with. That way, our usability tests would all be similar in nature and easy to check between one another.

*What we could improve:*

It was difficult to decide on what app to perform the usability test on, since some people had already done it by the time others had started.

*Overall experience:*

While it was simple enough to write and perform the test, it was difficult to get valuable responses from the user. For most of the test, the user did not have any frustrations or surprises with the process, and their reactions were very neutral. Thankfully, the times they did have a reaction were good enough to make up for this, so I was able to get a good amount of data from it.

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Search for a Recipe |
| Description / Steps | 1. The user navigates to the search menu within the app<br> 2. The user inputs a search term and presses the Search button<br> 3. A list of recipes is brought up based on the search term, organized by how well they match the user's current skill levels<br> 4. The user looks through the recipes until they find one they like<br> 5. The user either bookmarks the recipe for later use or selects it to begin cooking |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | The user has an account |
| Postconditions | The user will have bookmarked or completed a new recipe |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Epicurious](www.epicurious.com)
2. Competitor 2 [Yummly](www.yummly.com)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to the [website](www.yummly.com) | I chose yummly over epicurious because it focuses more on recipes over simply having articles |
| 2 | Sign up or create an account | This step can come later if necessary because it does not affect being able to look up recipes, only to save them |
| 3 | Search for a recipe or keyword | The search bar is at the top, and autofills suggestions |
| 4 | Select a recipe to look at | You can also hover over a recipe to see a preview of its ingredients, or bookmark it directly from the search menu |
| 5 | Bookmark the chosen recipe | You may have to go to a separate website to view directions |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |
| 4 |   |   |
| 5 |   |   |
